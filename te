          District Surrounding areas In India, Virudhunagar V.Nangoor
          Kalabairavar temple comes under Tamilnadu Hindu Religion
          Department..Kalabhairava is a Hindu deity, often associated with
          fierce aspects of Lord Shiva. Kalabhairava is considered the guardian
          deity of Kashi (Varanasi), and he is believed to be the one who
          presides over the city. The name "Kalabhairava" is derived from two
          Sanskrit words: "Kala," meaning time, and "Bhairava," referring to a
          fierce form of Lord Shivan.

          According to the legend, there was once a dispute between Brahma, the
          creator of the universe, and Vishnu, the preserver. The two gods were
          arguing about their superiority, each claiming to be the supreme
          deity. The disagreement became intense, and as a result, a fiery and
          fearsome being emerged from the forehead of Brahma. This fierce being
          came to be known as Kalabhairava. Kalabhairava, now a manifestation of
          Shiva's anger, took the form of a terrifying black dog. In this form,
          he chased Brahma to teach him a lesson. Kalabhairava, in the form of
          the black dog, chased Brahma wherever he went. Realizing the gravity
          of the situation and the divine nature of Kalabhairava, Brahma sought
          forgiveness and asked for a way to atone for his actions.
          Kalabhairava, in his fierce form, forgave Brahma but cursed him for
          his arrogance. The curse was that Brahma would lose his importance in
          the worship rituals. It is believed that this curse is the reason why
          there are very few temples dedicated to Brahma, and he is not as
          widely worshipped as other deities in Hinduism. As a result of the
          curse, Brahma realized his mistake and sought redemption. He began to
          perform penance at the sacred city of Kashi (Varanasi). To seek
          forgiveness from Kalabhairava, Brahma installed a Shiva Lingam at
          Kashi and performed intense prayers. Pleased with Brahma's penance,
          Kalabhairava forgave him and granted him salvation. Since then,
          Kalabhairava has been worshipped as the guardian deity of Kashi, and
          it is believed that he protects the city and its residents. Devotees
          also seek his blessings for the effective management of time and the
          removal of obstacles. This legend emphasizes the importance of
          humility and the consequences of arrogance, even among the divine
          beings. It also highlights the significance of Kalabhairava as a
          powerful and fierce form of Lord Shiva, associated with the control of
          time and the dispensation of justice.
